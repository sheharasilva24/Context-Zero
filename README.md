## üèÉ Running the Project

### Requirements:
- Node.js v20+  
- MongoDB (local or managed service like Atlas)  
- AWS S3 credentials (optional, if using cloud storage)  
- FFMPEG (optional, for video thumbnail generation)

### Steps to Run:

1. Install the dependencies:

```bash
npm i
```

2. Set the environment to **development**:

```bash
export NODE_ENV=development
```

3. Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

4. Access the app at: `http://localhost:3000`

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Installation Issues

* **Linux Build Tools Missing:** Install required packages:

```bash
sudo apt-get install build-essential
```

* **Node.js Memory Issues on Build:** Increase memory allocation for Node:

```bash
NODE_OPTIONS="--max-old-space-size=4096" npm run build
```
